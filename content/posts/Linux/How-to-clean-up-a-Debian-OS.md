### If using a desktop environment, empty the trash to reclaim space.

### Check for large files:

Identify and remove large files and directories using du or ncdu.

- Conclusion:

Regularly cleaning up your Debian OS not only frees up valuable disk space but also ensures optimal system performance. By following these steps, you can maintain a streamlined and efficient Debian environment. Always exercise caution and review commands before execution to avoid unintended consequences.
