Internet Wayback Machine Hacked, 31 Million Credentials Leaked

--- 

Looks like the [Internet Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/) has been hacked, with around 31 million user credentials stolen including Internet Archive's authentication database(About 6.4GB SQL file). The siteâ€™s been down for over a day now. If you've ever used the Internet Archive, there's a good chance your passwords might be out in the wild.

The hackers are claiming theyâ€™re pro-Palestine, but in my opinion, itâ€™s likely that theyâ€™re not genuinely supporting that cause. No matter their intentions, this will impact all the users of the archive, and people will blame the hackers regardless.(That's one of the intentions,innit ðŸ˜…)

Iâ€™ve noticed the Internet Archive has been under heavy DDoS attacks these past few days, and now this. The siteâ€™s currently down for maintenance, and theyâ€™ve said theyâ€™ll be back soon.

Go check the [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) site to see if your infoâ€™s been leaked.

IMO, I believe that this is a state/corporation-sponsored attack from a certain perspective. ðŸ’²
